Make no mistake, this is not the digital cash that Cypherpunks
espouse. This gives the credit agencies and the government (the two
work hand in hand) complete traceability of all purchases, automatic
reporting of spending patterns, target lists for those who frequent
about-to-be-outlawed businesses, and invasive surveillance of all
inter-personal economic transactions.

This is the AntiCash.

Beware the Number of the AntiCash.
